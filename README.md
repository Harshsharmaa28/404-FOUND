## Working 

![image info](./public/assests/Flow%20Diagram.png)



Based on the flow diagram you sent, it appears to illustrate two possible user journeys on your website, both of which start from the landing page.

* *Path 1: Find a Mentor*
    * The user clicks on the "Get Right Mentors" button on the landing page.
    * This leads them to a page where they can find mentors ("Mentorship").

* *Path 2: Improve Academics*
    * The user clicks on the "Improve Your Academics" text on the landing page.
    * This takes them to an "Academics" landing page.
    * From there, they can presumably explore more specific resources or information related to improving their academics.

Overall, the flow diagram provides a simple visual representation of the two main functionalities your website offers: connecting users with mentors and providing academicÂ resources.
